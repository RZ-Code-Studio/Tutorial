# Simple HTML tags

Quickly open your text editor open your file and remove your text and type:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
		<title>Your title</title>
	</head>
    <body>
	<h1>My first webpage</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now save your file and open your file in your broswer.

You saw it the text became bold text and it is big

The h1 tag means header1. It is usually used on the title of webpages in the body tag. You can use h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6.

h1 is most important while h6 is least.

Then add `<p>Hello World!</p>` after your h1. You know the drill.

SAVE, REFRESH!

The p tag is the paragrpah tag. It's just the tag that holds normal text.

Now replace `<p>Hello World!</p>` with `<p><strong>Hello World!</strong></p>`

Save, refresh and the text should become bold. Now add in the em tag inside of the strong tag

Save, Refresh and it is now italic text. You can replace strong with b and em with i

But the result would stay the same. That's it for the text tags tutorial!!!
